Tell Me About Yourself
I started my career in 2011 as a fresher with ABC Company, where I worked on creating RESTful services using the Jersey framework. My primary responsibilities included designing and developing APIs, testing them rigorously, and deploying them to production servers. This foundational experience taught me the importance of delivering high-quality, scalable APIs that serve as the backbone of modern applications.

In my next assignment, I expanded my skill set by delving into front-end development. I worked on AngularJS to develop user interfaces and also contributed to building a mobile application. During this period, I gained hands-on experience with PhoneGap, enabling me to create hybrid mobile applications for both Android and iOS platforms.

One of my most defining career moments came when I moved onsite to Malaysia. As the sole developer for the project, I was entrusted with end-to-end ownership of the solution. I handled both the front end, developed in Angular, and the back end, powered by microservices. From development to deployment, I was responsible for ensuring the project’s success, which honed my problem-solving skills and ability to manage complex systems independently.

Upon returning to India, I took on a leadership role where I led a team of five engineers to support one of the largest leading banks’ mobile applications. My responsibilities extended beyond development to resolving technical challenges, mentoring my team, and ensuring timely delivery of high-quality features. This role deepened my understanding of how to align technical solutions with business needs while managing a team effectively.

In my subsequent assignment, I worked as a Lead Full Stack Developer, where I was also involved in providing technical architecture solutions. I played a crucial role in designing and implementing CI/CD pipelines for applications, which streamlined the development and deployment processes. This experience allowed me to bridge the gap between development and operations, ensuring seamless releases and improved productivity.

Over the course of my career, I have developed strong expertise in a broad technology stack, including HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, React, Angular, Node.js, Java, Spring, Spring Boot, and microservices. My ability to adapt to new challenges and take ownership of projects has been a constant throughout my journey.

What excites me most is leveraging my technical expertise and leadership experience to solve complex problems and deliver value-driven solutions. I actively keep myself updated with industry trends and advancements, which allows me to stay ahead of the curve and contribute effectively to any team or project.
