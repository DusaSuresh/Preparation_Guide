Security:
==========

-> XSS - React itself take care using escape but dangerouslySetHtml in this case input has to be sanitized. Sanitization done using DOMPurify library.

-> CSP - Consent Security Policies . Normally will load js, css, frames, images etc. Here if we add few polices like allow those domains only it will allow.

-> Authentication —> Authentication data should not be handled at client side. If you use cookies for token then only use HttpOnly. This one will not be accessible from JS.

-> CSRF -> This one will be handled at server side, if we keep this server will check for specific domains.

-> CORS -> Any external calls will be stopped by placing cars at server side. It will allow only specific domain calls by using Access-control-allow-origin

-> Input sanitization —>Always sanitize the input received from the forms or urls before using it.

-> Https - Always use https in network layer calls. This one will provide security at network by mTLS.

-> RateLimit - use debounce, throttling for making an api calls by stopping always making server side calls

-> Error handling -> Proper error handling has to be implemented.

-> Logging & Observability -> don’t add any sensitive data into logs. 

-> UI must not load in iframe -> X-FRAME-OPTIONS: DENY

Performance
=============

Core Web Vitals Assessment
---------------------------
- Most of the page performance is dependent on images size, Images size should be less than 20kb. If we make it, them most of the cases will resolve.
- While loading the images using link tag, we can keep "preload" flag, it will load without waiting for other scripts to load.
- Few external scripts will also take time to load, those needs to loaded properly to improve it.

LCP -> Largest Contentful Paint
FCP -> First Contentful Paint
CLS -> Cumulative Layout Shift - For example if in three rows images are getting loaded and in one row images loading little bit late. When it loaded automatically layout will shift.

-> We can check this performance metrics in "lighthouse" in iinspect element.
-> Performance of the site can also be checked in below sites.
