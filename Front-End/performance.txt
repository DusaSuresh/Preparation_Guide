Core Web Vitals Assessment
---------------------------
- Most of the page performance is dependent on images size, Images size should be less than 20kb. If we make it, them most of the cases will resolve.
- While loading the images using link tag, we can keep "preload" flag, it will load without waiting for other scripts to load.
- Few external scripts will also take time to load, those needs to loaded properly to improve it.

LCP -> Largest Contentful Paint
FCP -> First Contentful Paint
CLS -> Cumulative Layout Shift - For example if in three rows images are getting loaded and in one row images loading little bit late. When it loaded automatically layout will shift.

-> We can check this performance metrics in "lighthouse" in iinspect element.
-> Performance of the site can also be checked in below sites.
